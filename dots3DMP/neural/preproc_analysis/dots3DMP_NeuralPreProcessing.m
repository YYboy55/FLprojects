% This script generates a large dataStruct containing spike sorted units from rigB (dots3DMP recordings)
% 
% Included sessions (and the row structure of dataStruct) is specified in RecSessionInfo.xlsx
%
% organization of dataStruct:
%
% 1 - each row in dataStruct pertains to one recording 'session'
% (block/set) (in practice, this means each day) from a given probe
% each row contains relevant metadata about recording, and a 'data' field
% 2 - each data field contains subfields for each recorded paradigm
% paradigm can be one of:
% 'VesMapping','RFMapping','dots3DMPtuning','dots3DMP'
%
% each paradigm contains:
%
%   'events'    condition information for each trial, as well as the timing of key stimulus and behavioral events)
%   'pldaps'    useful pldaps information for each trial, largely bookkeeping
%   'units'     
%       'cluster_id'   :  1 x N ids, where N = number of clusters
%       'cluster_type' :  1 x N corresponding to cluster_ids above. By Kilosort convention,
%                               1 = MU, 2 = SU, (3 = noise, not included by default)
%                               if keepMU==1, MUs will be included, otherwise only SUs will be included in output struct
%       'cluster_label':  1 x N cluster labels (MU, SU, UN = 'unsorted')
%       'spiketimes'   :  1 x N cell array containing spike times for each cluster, within the range of the given paradigm
% 
% See createSessionData for understanding how the dataStruct is created 
% 
%
% Updates
%
% SJ 04-2023 extensive improvements to documentation
%            fixed issues with mismatched unitInfo - using readtable instead of textscan to read cluster_info files
%            restructured to use recording metadata spreadsheet for defining dataStruct 
% SJ 01-2023 all recordings use kilosort/phy (no more mksort - spikeInterface for single electrode recordings)
% SJ 08-2022 added in metadata (getUnitInfo.m)                          
%            cleanUp option - to sub-select desirable units
% SJ 06-2022 shifting of timestamps of multiple recordings. 
%            switched dataCell from {} to dataStruct () struct format.
%
% Warnings/possible bugs
%
% 1. assignment of unitInfo
% 2. dealing with non-kilosort/probe recordings
%
% % TODO:
%
% 1. remove redundancies in createSessionData / clean-up
% 2. remove createSetEvents
% 3. fix processing of phy_WC folders given lack of unitInfo

%% create one .mat file containing concatenated events from all paradigms for a given set

% SJ: initially wrote this to ease importing of data in Python code
% (for now) python code will rely on already created dataStruct here, so
% this is obsolete.
% also rather roundabout, because it duplicates some of the code in
% createSessionData dealing with multiple RippleEvents files for one
% recording

% as it stands a BUG FIX is required - ending up with some mismatches in
% vector lengths
% issue arising from RFmapping having some different fields to other pars

% paradigms = {'dots3DMPtuning','dots3DMP','RFMapping','VesMapping'}; % use all pars
